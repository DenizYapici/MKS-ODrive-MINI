# Disclaimer / Learning Purpose Notice

This project is a custom redesign of the MKS ODrive MINI board.
I created this 4-layer PCB layout to improve my understanding of complex component placement, microcontroller and motor driver control, encoder interfaces, and the overall working principles of such systems.

The schematic used as a reference was obtained from publicly available sources on the internet.
This design is not intended for sale, production, or commercial use. It was created solely for educational and learning purposes.

## MKS ODrive MINI – Educational 4-Layer PCB Redesign
- **📌 Disclaimer / Learning Purpose Notice**

This project is a custom educational redesign of the MKS ODrive MINI motor controller board.
I designed this 4-layer PCB layout to deepen my understanding of:

Complex multi-layer PCB design

High-current motor driver layout principles

Microcontroller circuitry and power distribution

Encoder signal conditioning and interface design

Mixed-signal routing techniques (digital + motor power)

Component placement strategies in dense PCB designs

The schematic used as a reference was collected from publicly available online resources.

This board is NOT intended for commercial use, manufacturing, or sale.
It is created solely for personal learning and experimentation.

- **📘 Project Overview**

This repository contains my independent redesign of the MKS ODrive MINI.
The aim of the project is to replicate and understand the functional architecture of the original board, including:

BLDC motor driver stages

Gate driver circuits

STM32 microcontroller subsystem

Encoder interfaces (ABZ / incremental)

Power stage layout and thermal considerations

Communication interfaces

Protection circuits and filtering elements

The design does not fully reproduce the original product and may contain changes, simplifications, or educational adaptations.
